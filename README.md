# dadler32

Implementation of ADLER-32 checksum.

From [RFC-1950](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt):

    The Adler-32 algorithm is much faster than the CRC32 algorithm yet
    still provides an extremely low probability of undetected errors.

All code and documentation (comments in interface section) are in unit [dadler32.pas](dadler32.pas).
